# Two-Dice

## Description

I created this program to take two numbers to represent the number of sides on two dice. It will then output the most likely sum of the two faces. I also created unit testing for this where i had to intialise a Mock console to manipulate my tests
 
The Input:

- It must be two numbers with a space in between for example: "3 3"

The Output:

- It will then run and return a single number or multiple numbers in accending order if they are equally likely.
